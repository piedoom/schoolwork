*USAT is sometimes perceived as negative and biased.  Why?*
> They aren't as in depth as other brands.  Although unbiased, sometimes it is seen as too simple.

*Will that change?*
> Maybe. USAT will try to elevate it where needed, but not everybody wants an in depth article.  Bite sized news is okay
> "I know I did it right when I get hate mail from everyone"

*Is it our job when desigining to have guidelines on how this kind of content should be created?*

*How do you value journalistic integrity?*
> USAT is not 24 hour breaking news.  They take time to review local and national news.

*How do the app and website differ?*
> There is some different functionality in the app.  App subscription and engagement is weak.  Most consumers view the website, not the app.

> Yes.

*What kind of info is on current usage/bounce rate, etc.*
